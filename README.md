What is Infine?

Infine is a decentralized onboarding platform built to empower unbanked communities by providing instant access to financial tools using only a government-issued ID. Backed by Polkadot’s secure and scalable infrastructure, Infine allows users to create DeFi wallets without needing literacy, bank accounts, or prior technical knowledge. The platform verifies users through scanned ID data, linking it to a unique Decentralized Identifier (DID) via a custom smart contract deployed on the Polkadot Asset Hub.
By enabling verifiable identity on-chain, Infine unlocks access to aid distribution, digital payments, and identity-based services for over 1.4 billion unbanked individuals worldwide. Designed for use in rural kiosks, NGO hubs, and refugee camps, the system ensures inclusivity through a simple, admin-led registration process. Infine bridges the gap between Web2 government identities and Web3 decentralized finance — making financial sovereignty accessible to all, regardless of education, location, or infrastructure.
